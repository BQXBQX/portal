## Create graphs

First, we need to create a graph instance, which will be used for subsequent data modeling, loading, and querying. To do this, click the "Create instance" button located in the upper-right corner of the page.

By default, the engine type here uses the one provided by Coordinator, which is GraphScope Interactive. Click "Create." Once the instance is successfully created, you will be automatically redirected to the Modeling" page.

However, letâ€™s not rush ahead. Click on "Graphs" to return to the instance list. Pay special attention: in GraphScope
Interactive, an instance is only considered fully created after the model has been defined. Therefore, the status of the
instances in this list will be marked as "Draft" until that step is completed.
