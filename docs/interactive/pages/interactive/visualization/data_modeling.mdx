## Visual Graph Modeling

Traditional data modeling often requires tedious template configurations. GraphScope Portal's Data Modeling module offers a free-form canvas where users can intuitively design graph models as if sketching on a whiteboard, with real-time WYSIWYG editing. For structured CSV data, it provides one-click auto-import modeling and supports manual refinements, significantly boosting modeling efficiency

## Launching GraphScope Portal

We provide an [Online Portal](https://gsp.vercel.app/#/setting) where you only need to fill in the `coordinator address` of the Interactive Service on the settings configuration page.

In addition, we offer two more ways to launch the GraphScope portal:

### Option 1: Launch via Docker;

```bash
# Pull the GraphScope Portal  Docker image

docker pull ghcr.io/graphscope/portal:latest

# Start server

docker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name my-portal ghcr.io/graphscope/portal:latest
```

### Option 2: Launch via source code.

```bash
# git clone repo

git clone https://github.com/GraphScope/portal.git

# Compile front-end assets

npm run ci

# Start the server

cd packages/studio-website/server
npm run dev
```
