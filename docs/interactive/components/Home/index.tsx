    description: `
   GOpt is a graph-native query optimizer designed to accelerate query execution. It excels in handling hybrid scenarios that combine complex graph pattern matching with relational operations on large graphs. GOpt is not aware of the underlying storage data and focuses solely on computation on top of the data, which makes it easy and fast to be integrated into other graph or relational databases. The LDBC benchmark results show that GOpt significantly outperforms Neo4j. On the Neo4j execution engine, GOpt is 8.8x faster than Neo4jâ€™s plan. Even more impressive, on the GraphScope execution engine, GOpt achieves a speedup of 33x. This makes GOpt a powerful choice for optimizing graph database performance.
